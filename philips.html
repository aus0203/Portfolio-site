                    in order to improve their experience. </h2>
                <p>The response from the questionnaires consisting of 85 previous patients has turned into the customer
                    journey, which served us to identify the most important touchpoints to develop our strategy.
                </p>
                <p>It is also important to highlight that patients want to be better educated in healthcare,
                    specifically when it comes to their own health. As functional benefits for consumers, PHR (Personal
                    health record) is a way to save money and
                    time. It is easier for
                    them to provide the info when needed, for example while visiting a new
                    doctor, traveling or emergencies (Activdoctors, 2015).

            <p>The second big insight is the competition is broad, <strong>none of the existing PHRs is able to provide
                    the services with such a reliable and known brand as Philips can.</strong></p>
            <p>Morevoer, the third insight indicates that the features of PHRs are highlighted but this is not effective
                in gaining trust from customers.<strong>The emotional benefit should be targeted to go past the
                    feature-focus.</strong></p>

                <p>With the help of an animation, the concept will be conveyed in the waiting room. An animation was
                    chosen as it supports branding: creating clarity. The problem is shown in the animation using a

                <p>The launch of the strategy will start in September 2018. As figure 17 shows, the touchpoints that are associated to a department have different launching periods. It has been assigned a difference of two weeks for every department in order to have enough time to make adaptations in case unexpected events take place.</p>
