        <h3>Foodtrick (the previous version of SUPPER) is a fresh-frozen food service system, providing a simplified
            cooking procedure to tackle operational hurdles in the food service industry, such as labour shortage and
            increasing food wastage.</h3>
        <p>WeDesignFood attempts to expand the business of Foodtrick, a fresh-frozen food service system, and launch it
            as a formal brand. Aiming for the <strong>business-to-business market (B2B)</strong>, WeDesignFood wishes to
            persuade
            existing commercial food services or general enterprises to adopt Foodtrick.</p>

        <h3>However, the negative image of the <strong>frozen ready meal</strong> will create hesitations and increase
            the perceived uncertainty.</h3>
        <p>If potential buyers still consider frozen food to be low-price and of inferior quality, they will not be
            willing
            to engage. Thus, helping Foodtrick to re-sculpture its value correctly and adequately is essential.</p>

            and the possible channels (i.e. how) need to be determined. These factors were furthermore translated into
            the functional benefits and emotional benefits to construct a unique proposition (i.e. why).</p>
